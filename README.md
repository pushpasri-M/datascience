Data Science:
Data science is a multidisciplinary field that uses various techniques, algorithms, processes, and systems to extract insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data. It encompasses a wide range of activities, including data collection, cleaning, analysis, modeling, and interpretation, to make data-driven decisions and predictions. Data scientists play a crucial role in turning data into actionable insights that can drive business, scientific, or societal outcomes.

# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA is an essential part of the data science process.
It involves the initial examination and understanding of a dataset before any formal statistical or machine learning modeling. The primary goals of EDA are to:

Summarize Data:
Get an overview of the dataset's key characteristics, such as mean, median, standard deviation, and distribution of variables.

Detect Patterns and Anomalies: 
Identify patterns, trends, and potential outliers or anomalies in the data.

Formulate Hypotheses:
Generate hypotheses about relationships between variables or potential insights that can be further investigated.

Data Cleaning:
Identify and handle missing values, duplicates, and other data quality issues.
