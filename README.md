Data Science:
Data science is a multidisciplinary field that uses various techniques, algorithms, processes, and systems to extract insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data. It encompasses a wide range of activities, including data collection, cleaning, analysis, modeling, and interpretation, to make data-driven decisions and predictions. Data scientists play a crucial role in turning data into actionable insights that can drive business, scientific, or societal outcomes.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
EDA is an essential part of the data science process.
It involves the initial examination and understanding of a dataset before any formal statistical or machine learning modeling. The primary goals of EDA are to:

Summarize Data:
Get an overview of the dataset's key characteristics, such as mean, median, standard deviation, and distribution of variables.

Detect Patterns and Anomalies: 
Identify patterns, trends, and potential outliers or anomalies in the data.

Formulate Hypotheses:
Generate hypotheses about relationships between variables or potential insights that can be further investigated.

Data Cleaning:
Identify and handle missing values, duplicates, and other data quality issues.

Data Visualization:
Present data visually to gain a better understanding and communicate findings effectively.  
Visualization Techniques in EDA:

Data visualization is a crucial aspect of EDA because it helps analysts and data scientists explore data, uncover insights, and communicate findings. Here are some commonly used visualization techniques in EDA:
Line Chart: A line chart displays data points as markers connected by lines. It is useful for showing trends and patterns over a continuous dimension, such as time.

Bar Chart: Bar charts represent data using rectangular bars, where the length of each bar is proportional to the value it represents. They are effective for comparing categories or discrete data.

Scatter Plot: Scatter plots display individual data points as dots on a two-dimensional plane. They are used to visualize the relationship or correlation between two continuous variables.

Polar Plot: A polar plot is a circular graph where data points are plotted along radial axes. It's particularly useful for visualizing cyclical or periodic data, such as circular histograms.

Pie Chart: A pie chart represents data as a circular graph divided into slices, with each slice representing a category's proportion of the whole. It's used to display parts of a whole.

Stacked Plot (Stacked Bar Chart): A stacked plot is similar to a bar chart, but it stacks bars on top of each other to show the composition of each category in relation to the total. It's used for comparing categories while also displaying their composition.

Table: A table is a simple grid-based representation of data, often used to display raw data values or summary statistics in a structured format.

Histogram: A histogram displays the distribution of a single variable by dividing it into bins and representing the frequency or count of data points in each bin. It's effective for visualizing data distribution.

Lollipop Chart: A lollipop chart is a combination of a bar chart and a line chart. It consists of a bar (lollipop stick) and a data point (lollipop head) representing a value. It's often used to emphasize individual data points within a categorical content.
